PHR_SWAT_V1_A8:
Takes an excel file with super specific columns spat out by a SAP query and crunches some numbers for a recurring report
required in my job. Gets last paid prices, shows price change over time highlighting if it has increased or decreased,
shows price change over time in percentage terms, and yeah, stuff like that. Literally fed the thing to AI over and
over again until I got this. I figure you could change it to suit your needs, maybe change the columns it looks for
or something. PHR stands for "Price History Report", if you were wondering.... SWAT is just an inside joke. SWAT mode
will probably not work for you, as it takes, again, a super specific excel file with super specific columns that's used
in my department. If you run Pyinstaller to get an .exe file, you'll get a 220 MB executable, which will take a minute or 
two to open, but runs just fine.

Python_Pack_V1:
Fetches files, generates folders, renames files within folders according to the folder name, and marks folders according
to doc or image presence. Mostly used to skip having to make a gazillion folders by hand. Pop in your list of folder names
and be happy.
